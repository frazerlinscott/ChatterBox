### Angular (Node)

Angular is a popular front-end framework that utilizes Node.js for development. Here's how to set up and work with Angular:

1. **Install Node.js and npm**: Before you can work with Angular, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. You can download them from the official Node.js website: [Node.js Downloads](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

2. **Install Angular CLI**: The Angular Command Line Interface (CLI) is a powerful tool for creating, building, testing, and deploying Angular applications. Install it globally using npm with the following command:
   
   ```bash
   npm install -g @angular/cli
