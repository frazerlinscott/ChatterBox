# Project README





### Angular (Node)

Angular is a popular front-end framework that utilizes Node.js for development. Here's how to set up and work with Angular:

1. **Install Node.js and npm**: Before you can work with Angular, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. You can download them from the official Node.js website: [Node.js Downloads](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

- **Node Express**
- **Jquery**
- **Bootstrap**

2. **Install Angular CLI**: The Angular Command Line Interface (CLI) is a powerful tool for creating, building, testing, and deploying Angular applications. Install it globally using npm with the following command:
   
   ```bash
   npm install -g @angular/cli


# Git Repository Organization and Development Process

## Repository Name
`Assignment1_SoftwareFrames_s2930588`

## Branch Organization

The repository consists of a main branch and several feature-specific branches. Here's a breakdown:

- **Main (Default Branch)**: This branch contains the stable version of the project. Any fully developed and tested features are merged into this branch.
- **Page Authentication and Styling**: This branch focuses on the authentication process and associated UI styling.
- **Create User**: Branch dedicated to features related to creating a new user.
- **UserPage**: Branch where development of a list of all the users so the super admin is able to change user permission. 
- **Groups**: Branch for developing group-related functionalities.
- **Channels**: This branch is used for implementing channel-related features.
- **DBIntergration**: This branch is used to intergrate MONOGO DB into the system. 

## Development Process

1. **Branch Creation**: Whenever a new feature or functionality is to be added, a new branch is created from the main branch.
2. **Development**: All the development activities, be it coding, initial testing, or UI enhancements, happen within these feature branches.
3. **Multiple Commits**: Multiple commits to the current branch are made until branch is fully functional. 
4. **Merging**: Once the feature is tested and deemed stable, the feature branch is merged into the main branch.
5. **Repeat Step 1 - 4**: I repeated these steps until the system is fully functional. 

# System Explanation

The system is architected to emphasize real-time communication and efficient data handling, bridging an Angular frontend with a backend powered by Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

## Server Side

### 1. **Setup & Configuration**:

- **Express Application**: The main server operates using `Express`, and it's configured to run on port `3000`.
- **Real-time Communication**: `socket.io` is integrated to handle real-time chat functionalities.
- **Database**: A local MongoDB database named `liveChatSystem` is in use.
- **CORS**: Cross-origin requests are allowed from `http://localhost:4200`, which is presumably the development URL for the Angular client.
- **File Management**: `Multer` is used to handle file uploads, with separate configurations for regular uploads and chat attachments.
- **Routes**: Various functionalities like login, messaging, and group management are encapsulated within distinct route files which are imported into the main server file.

### 2. **Database Interactions**:

- The system processes incoming HTTP requests via several route files (e.g., `login_DB.js`, `message_DB.js`). These routes facilitate the interaction with the MongoDB database to perform CRUD operations.
- Real-time chat or notifications are potentially managed through a `sockets.js` module which also has the ability to interact with the database.

### 3. **Socket Interactions**:

- A dedicated `sockets.js` module (content not provided) possibly caters to real-time chat or other live interactions, leveraging the capabilities of `socket.io`.

## Client Side

### 1. **Socket Service**:

- Establishes and manages a socket connection with the server at `http://localhost:3000`.
- Facilitates joining a specific chat channel.
- Sends chat messages coupled with user metadata and possible attachments.
- Monitors for real-time incoming chat messages.
- The current user's credentials are fetched from the session storage to link messages with the respective sender.

### 2. **Upload Service**:

- Entrusted with file uploadsâ€”presumably profile photos and chat attachments.
- Executes this by initiating POST requests to the server, which in turn, processes the uploads using Multer and potentially archives the metadata in the database.

## Interaction Flow:

### 1. **File Upload**:

- When a user opts to upload a file via the Angular frontend, the `UploadService` triggers a POST request with the respective file to the server.
- Server-side routes (like `uploadPic_DB.js`) process this request, store the file in the specified directory, and likely log the metadata in the database.

### 2. **Real-time Chat**:

- As a user inputs a message in a chat interface on the Angular frontend, the `SocketService.send` method is invoked, broadcasting the message and associated details through the socket.
- On the server side, a listener (assumedly in `sockets.js`) captures this message, processes it (which might include archiving it in the database), and relays it to other connected clients.


## Data Structures 

### LoginComponent Class:

#### Properties:
- `userpwd`: An object with two properties: `username` and `pwd`. These properties represent the input values of a login form.

#### Methods:
- `loginfunc()`: This function is triggered to log in a user. It makes a POST HTTP request to the "/login" endpoint of the backend, passing in the user's credentials. After the request, the response is processed, and based on the response, the function either saves user data to the session storage and redirects to the 'account' page or shows an alert if the login attempt is unsuccessful.
- `creatfunc()`: This function is for navigating to the 'create-user' route, to allow a user to create an account.

## Create User Component Class:

### Properties:

- **user**: This is an instance of the User class. 
  - It is initialized with default values.
- **allUsernames**: This is an array of strings. It holds a list of usernames fetched from the server, which will be used to check if a new username is unique.
- **isUniqueUsername**: A boolean that indicates if the username inputted by the user is unique or not. It starts as true and is updated as the user types.
- **isUniquePassword**: A boolean that indicates if the password and its confirmation match. True means they match, false means they don't.
- **isUniqueEmail**: A boolean indicating whether the inputted email is unique or not.

### Methods:

- **onUsernameInput()**: This method checks if the username currently in the `user` object is unique by checking against the `allUsernames` array.
- **onCreate()**: This method gets called when trying to create a new user. It checks if the password matches its confirmation. If they match, it sends an HTTP POST request to the server to create the user. The server's response is checked to determine if the creation was successful or if there was an issue, like a duplicate.

## Accounts Component Class:

### Properties:

#### Primitive Data Types:
- **username**: A string representing the username of the logged-in user.

## Server Side Routes

### socket.js (Socket.IO Connection and Events)

#### **General Overview**
This module establishes a real-time connection between the server and its clients using Socket.IO. It also defines several event listeners and emitters for handling chat-related functionalities, like joining channels and sending/receiving messages.

---

#### `on: connection`
- **Parameters (internally by Socket.IO):**
  - `socket`: Object (Represents the individual client/socket connection)
- **Purpose:** Establishes a connection with the client and logs the connected user's socket ID.

---

#### `on: join`
- **Parameters:**
  - `channel`: String (The name of the chat channel the user wants to join)
- **Purpose:** Allows a user to join a specific chat channel. The user's socket will then receive messages sent to this channel.

---

#### `on: message`
- **Parameters:**
  - `data`: Object
    - `groupName`: String (Name of the group where the message belongs)
    - `channel`: String (Name of the channel within the group where the message belongs)
    - `message`: String (Actual content of the message)
    - `username`: String (Name of the user sending the message)
    - `profilePic`: String (Path to the user's profile picture)
    - `attachment`: (Could be any data type, specific type isn't clear from the provided code. Represents any attached files or data to the message)
- **Return Values (upon successfully saving message to database and emitting it):**
  - Emits a `message` event to the specific channel with:
    - `message`: String
    - `channel`: String
    - `username`: String
    - `profilePic`: String
    - `attachment`: [Data Type]
- **Purpose:** Receives a message from a client, saves it to the database, and then broadcasts it to other clients within the same chat channel.

---

### `saveMessageToDb(db, messageData)`

- **Parameters:**
  - `db`: Object (Database connection object)
  - `messageData`: Object (The message details that need to be saved to the database, structure similar to the `data` object in `on: message`)
- **Purpose:** Saves the provided message to the 'chatData' collection in the database. If the group or channel doesn't exist, it will create them. If they do exist, it will append the new message to the appropriate channel within the group.

---

### `/attachPhoto`
- **HTTP Method:** POST
- **Parameters:**
  - **File (multipart/form-data):** A photo that needs to be attached.
- **Return Values:**

If the user is found in the `UserData` collection in the database and the `valid` flag is true, the user data is returned in the response. If no matching user is found, a failure response is returned. In case of any database-related issues or errors, an error message is returned.

### `/messages`

- **HTTP Method:** GET
- **Parameters (query parameters):**
  - `groupName`: String
  - `channelName`: String
- **Return Values:**
  - **Success:** Array of messages (with attachment file paths if present)
  - **Failure (Invalid parameters):** `{ error: 'Both groupName and channelName are required.' }`

  - **Failure (Channel not found):** `{ error: 'Channel not found in the given group.' }`
  - **Failure (Server Error):** `{ error: 'Internal server error' }`
- **Purpose:** The endpoint retrieves messages from a specified channel within a specified group. If the messages contain attachments, the file path for each attachment is also fetched and included in the message object. If either the group or channel is not found, appropriate error responses are returned. Any other errors result in a generic error message.

### `/update-groups`

- **HTTP Method:** POST
- **Parameters (body):**
  - `updatedGroup`: Object (Group details to be updated or inserted)
    - `_id` (optional for updates): MongoDB ObjectId (The ID of the group to update)
